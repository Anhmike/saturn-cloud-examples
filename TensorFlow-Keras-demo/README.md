**Neural Network** is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.

This model takes data from [NYC Taxi Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) to try to predict total fares from trip. This model runs both on CPU/GPU and requires 128GB of RAM to run.

For information about TensorFlow, refer to the [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide).
